<p>TROVe is a search engine for digital humanities that allows researchers to explore and partly analyse public debates and discourses thought he the diffusion of news and opinion through different media and time. Specific roles of different media can be explored and their mutual relations &amp; reactions can be laid bare.</p>
<p>In TROVe, researches can identify important actors and moments that (have) play(ed) a role in discursive constructions. TROVe also gives insights in the way broadcast-, online &amp; social media interact and play a role in public debates. TROVe is a collaborative project of&nbsp;<a href="https://tvintransition.wordpress.com" target="_blank">Utrecht University's Centre for Television in Transition</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://isla.science.uva.nl" target="_blank">Intelligent Systems Lab Amsterdam</a>&nbsp;and the Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision. The partners worked together with&nbsp;<a href="http://dispectu.com" target="_blank">Dispectu</a>&nbsp;for the development of the back-end, and with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.frontwise.com" target="_blank">Frontwise</a>&nbsp;for the design and development of the interface.</p>
