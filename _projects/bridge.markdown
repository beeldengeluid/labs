BRIDGE focusses on access to television archives. Broadcasting organizations have moved to cross-media production companies where users are directly involved in online discussions afterwards. To be meaningful, these additional materials must be linked to the traditionally archived television material in order to arrive at a useful web of information.

The project develops, tests and implements efficient, effective and robust methods for automatically creating meaningful links between dynamically expanding archived television data and other information sources centered around entities, themes and events. The network of related entities resulting from this will be made available by means of an interface for exploration of the catalog.
