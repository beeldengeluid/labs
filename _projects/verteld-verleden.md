In various projects NISV, DANS, Erasmus University, Atria and Meertens Instituut developed a search portal for Oral History interviews based on the concept that collections reside with the original content owners and are searchable via a single platform using the OAI-PMH protocol. The search interface was developed in collaboration with Oral Historians.

In CLARIAH, the platform will be extended by adding more collections, improving the underlying distributed interface and by fine-tuning the application towards a sustainable tool for research into interview collections.
