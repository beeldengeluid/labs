#### What about LABS?

Sound and Vision LABS represent the *Research & Development* activities on a wide range of *Media Innovation* topics at the Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision. You will find showcases of tools, demos and prototypes that have been developed in the past years with our (inter)national partners in research and industry. But also, LABS is a way to engage in new research together with us, using **real data** and related to **real-life use cases** in *media*, *cultural heritage*, *research*, *education* and *journalism*. Check-out our research pages to get an impression on what we are doing and how to collaborate with us.  

Please note that in some cases the showcases require authentication for access. You can request access via the contact details on the application page.

#### What about Sound and Vision?

[The Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision](https://www.beeldengeluid.nl) is an advanced and trendsetting audiovisual archive that has successfully made its way into the digital realm. It maintains and provides access to over 1 million hours of television, radio, music, film and web video, making it one of the largest audiovisual archives in Europe. Sound and Vision makes their collection available online for various end-user services, including dedicated services for the creative industries, education and research. The institute operates as a visitor attraction aimed at the general public and is visited by over 250.000 people annually.

**Our mission statement:**  
_The Research and Development (R&D) department has their finger on the pulse of the environment in which Sound and Vision operates.  New trends, changing needs, technological developments and a dynamic social context demand an organisation that moves fluidly while gaining knowledge, expertise and innovative capacity. With a critical eye and support from a broad, international network, R&D contributes to the mission of the institute: R&D initiates, stimulates and facilitates research and development. At the same time it also collects knowledge and practical examples from inside and outside the institute and offers this to knowledge organisations, colleagues in the sector and other interested parties._

The R&D research agenda focusses on five main themes: Access; Metadata and Context; Users; Humanities; and Preservation.
