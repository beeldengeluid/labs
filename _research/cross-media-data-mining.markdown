description: 'Interrelate information across collections  '
---

The Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision is famous about its large Radio and Television collection consisting of audio and video data of the Dutch Public Broadcasters. However, we also have so-called context collections such as Viewing and Listening Ratings, Program Guides and all sorts of documents that were created during the production process such as auto-cues, contracts and scripts. In addition, we are collaborating with other institutions such as the National Library and Eye Film Institute (see e.g. [Media Suite](https://mediasuite.clariah.nl/)) that have collections that have information that could be interrelated. This information can be (semi-)structured or not.

NISV and the users of the collections such as researchers and journalists are very interested in methods and techniques to mine data across collections that we have available.
