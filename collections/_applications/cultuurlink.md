CultuurLINK is developed for cultural heritage institutions to help them link their vocabularies, such as thesauri and term lists, with the Dutch cultural heritage Hub. The Hub contains thesauri from the Netherlands Institute for Sound & Vision, Naturalis, RCE and Getty.

With CultuurLINK you upload your vocabulary, select a target from the Hub and build your unique link strategy. With the graphical strategy editor you guide the alignment process step-by-step. Link your vocabulary to one source from the Hub or link subsets of your vocabulary to different sources from the Hub. Powerful matchers allow you to compare concepts by their labels using exact or fuzzy string match. Use structural properties such as hierachical relations to filter matches. The interface allows you to inspect the concepts and their attributes in the datatable. Directly see results of an operation and manually evaluate them.
