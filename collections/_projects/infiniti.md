Project Infiniti develops and enables the exploitation of open source and open standards tools to support semantic search. We develop retrieval models, algorithms and implementations that combine information retrieval and information extraction technology to provide genuine information access.

Our methods go beyond standard document retrieval and rank and characterize entities such as people, organizations, products, etc. We achieve this using automatically generated profiles, using the relations and developments that entities are part of and using the attitudes in which they are engaged.

The project's thematic lines start from existing toolkits and go through multiple cycles of use case analysis, algorithm development, methodological grounding and tool professionalization steps. A range of provide focus and grounding by supplying the project with use cases. The project's will initiate exploitation during its lifetime.
