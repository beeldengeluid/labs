<p>Spotvogel&nbsp;is a free online game where you type in words that belong to a fragment. The website of the Dutch nature tv show Vroege Vogels&nbsp;has an online archive, where&nbsp;over 600 different fragments can be found. Because&nbsp;there are so many fragments and the archive is still&nbsp;expanding, specific fragments can sometimes be quite difficult to find. As&nbsp;there are&nbsp;many naturalists active online (for example at the Vroege Vogels forum), viewers and nature lovers are invited to help get better descriptions of&nbsp;the archive&nbsp;in a fun and challenging way. The tags added by players can then be used as time-coded metadata to help make the archive better searchable.</p>
<p>The game was originally developed as Waisda? (with KRO). Later versions were made for NCRV Man bijt hond (Woordentikkertje) and VARA Vroege Vogels (Spotvogel).</p>
