<p>By bringing distant voices close, radio connects people and places. Radio Garden allows listeners to explore processes of broadcasting and hearing identities across the entire globe. From its very beginning, radio signals have crossed borders. Radio makers and listeners have imagined both connecting with distant cultures, as well as re-connecting with people from &lsquo;home&rsquo; from thousands of miles away &ndash; or using local community radio to make and enrich new homes.</p>
<p>In the section&nbsp;<strong>Live</strong>, you can explore a world or radio as it is happening right now. Tune into any place on the globe.&nbsp;In the section on&nbsp;<strong>History</strong>&nbsp;one can tune into clips from throughout radio history that show how radio has tried to cross borders.&nbsp;<strong>Jingles</strong>&nbsp;offers a world-wide crash course in station identification. In radio&nbsp;<strong>Stories</strong>&nbsp;listeners past and present tell how they listen beyond their walls.</p>
