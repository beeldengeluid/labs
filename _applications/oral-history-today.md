<p>In various projects NISV, DANS, Erasmus University, Atria and Meertens Instituut developed a search portal for Oral History interviews based on the concept that collections reside with the original content owners and are searchable via a single platform using the OAI-PMH protocol. The search interface was developed in collaboration with Oral Historians.</p>
<p>In CLARIAH, the platform will be extended by adding more collections, improving the underlying distributed interface and by fine-tuning the application towards a sustainable tool for research into interview collections.</p>
