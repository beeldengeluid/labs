The project "Gemeenschappelijke Thesaurus voor Uniforme Ontsluiting" (GTUO) was funded by the Taalunie -a cross-national organization focusing on the Dutch language- and executed by the Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision and the Flemish [VIAA archive](http://viaa.be/en/about-viaa/). It involved a case study where partial collections of the two archives were connected by aligning their thesauri. This involved the conversion of the VRT thesaurus to the SKOS format and linking it to Sound and Vision's GTAA thesaurus. The interactive alignment tool CultuurLINK, made by Dutch company Spinque was used to align the two thesauri. The links between the collections can be explored using a cross-collection browser, also built by Spinque. This allows users to search and explore connections between the two collections.</p>

Unfortunately, the collections are not publicly available so the demonstrator is password-protected, but a publicly accessible screencast shows the functionalities: [https://youtu.be/iOJvcHRfvDY](https://youtu.be/iOJvcHRfvDY)
