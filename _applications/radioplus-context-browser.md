<p>Radio can be much more then listening only. Radio can be made searchable to find a certain quote, person or topic. The experience of listening radio can be enhanced presenting related images from other information sources on a screen.&nbsp;Reversely, radio content can also be linked to information on the web. A written news story might be enriched with a related radio interview.&nbsp;We improve the use and experience of radio content by automatically processing audio files and combining the output with the latest audio search technology.</p>

<p>In this first version prototype we explore the possibilities of automatically linking news items to relevant audiovisual content in an archive, in this case radio content. For example when there is a news item on a novelist winning an award, the system should provide the user with relevant radio content such as a radio interview with the novelist, or radio items discussing this award.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Three important factors influence the quality of the system:</p>
<ol>
<li>the size of the underlying database with archive content (in a small database it will be hard to find relevant content for a given news item);</li>
<li>the type of content in the underlying database (in a collection of in-depth interviews on cultural topics it will be less probable to find content related to a sports news event);</li>
<li>the quality of the linking technology.</li>
</ol>
<p>The technology is connected to the <a href="http://www.woord.nl/start.html" target="_blank">Woord.nl</a>&nbsp;platform: a collection of historical and recent radio stories. Partners in our work are media industry representatives: content-owners (VPRO), archives (S&amp;V) and technology providers (Cross-Media Interaction).&nbsp;In this application, one of the main difficulties is to automatically extract those keywords from the news text that have the best chance of finding relevant content in the available database.&nbsp;</p>
