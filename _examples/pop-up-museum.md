The Pop-Up Museum is a hybrid of both a digital and physical museum exhibition. Using multiscreen technology, the exhibition can be controlled and interacted with by the visitors through a smartphone: answer questions, swipe through content, explore the storyline, select languages, and more interactive applications will be available. The Pop-Up Museum serves as an ideal extension to the main museum, as the mobile installation can be used at events and festivals to target a collection at a specific audience.
