<p>As part of the Europeana Creative project, Sound and Vision commissioned Australian artist Andy Thomas to create an inspirational digital sound sculpture re-using two bird sounds from its archive. Andy used different 3D software to emulate his visions of the sounds.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The video served as inspiration for creative industries to submit their ideas to a Europe wide competition.&nbsp;The bird sounds video is part of the Social Networks pilot, called <a title="Sound Connections" href="http://pro.europeana.eu/europeana-creative/pilots/social-networks-pilot" target="_blank">&ldquo;Sound Connections&rdquo;</a>, which is led by Sound and Vision. This pilot allows communities to enrich a variety of soundscapes (birds, aviation and city sounds) on an interactive map. See for instance the bird sounds&nbsp;<a title="Historypin" href="http://www.historypin.com/en/explore/birdlife" target="_blank">pilot page</a>.</p>
