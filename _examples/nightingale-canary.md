As part of the Europeana Creative project, Sound and Vision commissioned Australian artist Andy Thomas to create an inspirational digital sound sculpture re-using two bird sounds from its archive. Andy used different 3D software to emulate his visions of the sounds.

The video served as inspiration for creative industries to submit their ideas to a Europe wide competition. The bird sounds video is part of the Social Networks pilot, called ["Sound Connections"](https://pro.europeana.eu/page/social-networks-pilot), which is led by Sound and Vision. This pilot allows communities to enrich a variety of soundscapes (birds, aviation and city sounds) on an interactive map.
