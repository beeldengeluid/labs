Built on HTLM5, it is designed as a timeline that allows users to dig deeper into the rich source materials used in the final version.&nbsp;Users can shuttle back and forth between the timeline of the television broadcast and the second layer of source materials.&nbsp;Vidlink&rsquo;s back-end is editor-friendly and requires a minimal set-up. Time cues, file locations and descriptions are quickly edited in a shared spreadsheet. Our technical partners link the programme fragments to the archival sources.&nbsp;This low-friction mechanism allows web editors to quickly make changes to the desired length and visibility of the archive clips.</p>\n<p>In the context of the&nbsp;<a title=\"Europeana Awareness\" href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/europeana-awareness\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana Awareness</a>&nbsp;project, the Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision and&nbsp;<a title=\"Videodock\" href=\"http://videodock.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Videodock</a>&nbsp;now make Vidlink freely available for selected broadcasters.</p>", "descriptionShort": "Interactive documentary explorer", "thumb": "vidlink_poster.png", "tags": ["Documentary", "ASR", "Content Enrichments", "Radio stories"], "url": "http://www.nadebevrijding.nl/", "title": "VidLink", "contactPersons": [{"organization": "The Netherlands Institue of Sound and Vision", "email": "rd@beeldengeluid.nl", "name": "Erwin Verbruggen"}], "publications": [{"url": "http://mayor2.dia.fi.upm.es/oeg-upm/files/eswc2014/Workshops/LIME2014/lime2014_submission_6.pdf", "title": "Na de bevrijding XL: Expanding a Historical Television Series with Archival Sources"}], "bengThemes": ["Access, Use and Context"], "blogPosts": [{"url": "http://www.beeldengeluid.nl/en/vidlinks-second-layer-your-archives-showcase", "title": "Vidlink's second layer: your archive's showcase"}, {"url": "http://www.beeldengeluid.nl/en/blogs/research-amp-development-en/201503/adding-second-layer-polish-academy-movement-documentary", "title": "Adding the second layer to Polish Academy of Movement Documentary"}], "id": "dbd312fc-edb3-11e4-8099-005056a71e3a", "predecessors": [{"url": "http://www.nadebevrijding.nl", "name": "Na de Bevrijding XL"}]}, {"partners": ["Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision", "KRO", "VU University"], "descriptionLong": "<p>Waisda? is a video labeling game where players watch&nbsp;videos and add tags about what they see and hear.
