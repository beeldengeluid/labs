The experience of listening radio can be enhanced presenting related images from other information sources on a screen.&nbsp;Reversely, radio content can also be linked to information on the web. A written news story might be enriched with a related radio interview.&nbsp;We improve the use and experience of radio content by automatically processing audio files and combining the output with the latest audio search technology.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>In this first version prototype we explore the possibilities of automatically linking news items to relevant audiovisual content in an archive, in this case radio content. For example when there is a news item on a novelist winning an award, the system should provide the user with relevant radio content such as a radio interview with the novelist, or radio items discussing this award.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Three important factors influence the quality of the system:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>the size of the underlying database with archive content (in a small database it will be hard to find relevant content for a given news item);</li>\n<li>the type of content in the underlying database (in a collection of in-depth interviews on cultural topics it will be less probable to find content related to a sports news event);</li>\n<li>the quality of the linking technology.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The technology is connected to the <a href=\"http://www.woord.nl/start.html\" target=\"_blank\">Woord.nl</a>&nbsp;platform: a collection of historical and recent radio stories. Partners in our work are media industry representatives: content-owners (VPRO), archives (S&amp;V) and technology providers (Cross-Media Interaction).&nbsp;In this application, one of the main difficulties is to automatically extract those keywords from the news text that have the best chance of finding relevant content in the available database.&nbsp;</p>", "descriptionShort": "Contextualize RSS feeds with woord.nl content", "thumb": "woordnlfc_poster.png", "tags": ["Radio stories", "ASR", "Content Enrichments"], "url": "http://woordnl.rdlabs.beeldengeluid.nl/woordnl-fc", "poster": "woordnlfc_poster.png", "requestAuthentication": [], "title": "RadioPlus Context Browser", "access": "Open", "contentTypes": ["Audio"], "github": "", "publications": [{"url": "http://www.commit-nl.nl/sites/default/files/55.%20Enriching%20use%20and%20experience%20of%20radio%20content.pdf", "title": "Enriching use and experience of radio content"}], "bengThemes": ["Metadata & Context"], "blogposts": [], "id": "dbd10fca-edb3-11e4-8099-005056a71e3a"}, {"status": ["Completed"], "project": "ed1929a0-1b3c-11e5-9234-005056a71e3a", "descriptionLong": "<p>Spotvogel&nbsp;is a free online game where you type in words that belong to a fragment.
